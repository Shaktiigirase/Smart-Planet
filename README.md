# Smart Planet

This project automates watering plants by using a soil moisture sensor to detect dryness and controlling a water pump through the Arduino. It's simple, useful, and demonstrates proficiency with sensors, outputs, and Arduino coding.

Components Needed:
Arduino Uno or Nano
Soil moisture sensor
Mini water pump (5V or 12V)
Relay module (to control the pump)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Power supply (USB or battery)

Features:
Soil Moisture Detection: Reads the soil moisture levels using a sensor.
Automatic Watering: Turns on the water pump when the soil is dry.
LED Indicators: Lights up an LED when watering is active.
Threshold Customization: Users can adjust the moisture threshold in the code.
